# 0x04. Files Manager

## Description

This project is a summary of the back-end trimester covering the following topics:
- Authentication
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Pagination
- Background processing

The goal is to build a simple platform for uploading and viewing files with the following features:
- **User authentication** via a token
- **List all files**
- **Upload new files**
- **Change file permissions**
- **View files**
- **Generate thumbnails for images**

This project is designed to help you assemble various back-end concepts into a complete product. Although similar services exist in real life, this project serves as a learning experience. You will be guided step by step but will have some freedom in implementation, such as organizing your project into multiple files and using a `utils` folder.
